Installation Instructions for sdr-shell-v4 branch.

Distribution Specific Instructions

Fedora 14

(1) Install prerequisite packages with:

	if fedora was installed from the live cd:
	sudo yum install subversion autoconf gcc gcc-c++

	sudo yum install libtool qt-devel liblo-devel hamlib-devel
	sudo yum install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel 
	sudo yum install jack-audio-connection-kit-example-clients
	sudo yum install qjackctl alsa-util

	depenencies for dttsp:
		sudo yum install fftw-devel gsl-devel

	dependencies for usbsoftrock:
		sudo yum install libusb1-devel ncurses-devel

(2) Run 'qmake-qt4' to build the Makefile, then 'make' to build sdr-shell.

(3) Add yourself to the audio and jackusers groups in /etc/group.

(4) Configure udev to set usbsoftrock permissions (see below)

Ubuntu 10.10

(1) From a live CD installation of Ubuntu, Xubuntu or lubuntu, install

   Packages needed to build dttsp:
	sudo apt-get install automake build-essential subversion 
	sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev jackd2 libjack-jackd2-dev
	sudo apt-get install liblo-dev libgsl0-dev

	When installing jack, answer 'yes' to the question about setting up
	real-time priorities.

   Packages needed to build usbsoftrock:
	sudo apt-get install libusb++-dev libncurses5-dev

   Packages needed to build sdr-shell:
	sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev 
	sudo apt-get install libhamlib++-dev pkg-config 

(2) Run 'qmake-qt4' to build the Makefile, then 'make' to build sdr-shell.

(3) Add yourself to the audio and video groups in /etc/group.

	sudo usermod -G audio -a <user>
	sudo usermod -G video -a <user>

(4) If you did not answer 'yes' to the jack installation question about
real-time priorities, you may reconfigure it for real-time priorities with:

	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high jackd

(5) Configure udev to set usbsoftrock permissions (see below)

All Linux Systems

The following udev rules works well to allow the group softrock to use
usbsoftrock without root privileges. You can put it in /etc/udev/rules.d
and call it softrock.rules.

Fedora 9:
	BUS=="usb", ACTION=="add", SSSYSFS{idVendor}=="16c0", SYSFS{idProduct}=="05dc",
	MODE="660", GROUP="softrock"

Fedora 12+, openSUSE 11+, Ubuntu 9.10+ needs 
	SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{idVendor}=="16c0",
	ATTR{idProduct}=="05dc", MODE="0660", GROUP="admin", SYMLINK="softrock"

the group "softrock" must exist in /etc/group, or substitute another group
name.

Use jack_metro, a metronome, to figure out which ports are your speakers, etc.


Building for OSX 10.6 * not updated for qt4 *

sdr-shell-v4 on OSX doesn't preserve the background of the spectrogram frame.

When setting up to build for OSX, I wanted to use the fink and macports tools
to get the prerequisite packages.  I had very limited success in getting usable
prerequisites.  Both fink and macports build their packages in 32-bit (x86)
mode, while the compiler default on 10.6 is now 64 bit (x86_64) mode.  In order
to build against its packages requires setting:

	PATH=/sw/var/lib/fink/path-prefix-10.6:$PATH

Note that qt3mac from both package systems does not build on OSX 10.6 (it did
build on 10.5) and there doesn't appear to be anyone working on it.  Instead, I
selected 'qt3', which uses x11.

In all, I believe these packages were for building dttsp and sdr-shell:
  fink:
	qt3
  mac ports:
 	fftw-3 @3.2.2_0+i386 (active)
	fftw-3-single @3.2.2_0+i386 (active)
	gsl @1.13_1+darwin_i386 (active)

The more packages were built from source using the instructions in:

  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dttsp-linux/files/build-dttsp.sh 

I also had to build hamlib-1.2.9 (I recall having to do something ugly to
hamlib to get it to compile -- it probably doesn't work).

Get the JACK Audio Connection Kit from from jackosx.com.  I've never
gotten the JACK in fink or macports to work.
