Installation Instructions for sdr-shell-v4 branch.

# was installed sudo port install qt4-mac
# does not work on my mac osx qt4-x11


sdr-shell-v4 on OSX doesn't preserve the background of the spectrogram frame.

When setting up to build for OSX, I wanted to use the fink and macports tools
to get the prerequisite packages.  I had very limited success in getting usable
prerequisites.  Both fink and macports build their packages in 32-bit (x86)
mode, while the compiler default on 10.6 is now 64 bit (x86_64) mode.  In order
to build against its packages requires setting:

	PATH=/sw/var/lib/fink/path-prefix-10.6:$PATH

Note that qt3mac from both package systems does not build on OSX 10.6 (it did
build on 10.5) and there doesn't appear to be anyone working on it.  Instead, I
selected 'qt3', which uses x11.

In all, I believe these packages were for building dttsp and sdr-shell:
  fink:
	qt3
  mac ports:
 	fftw-3 @3.2.2_0+i386 (active)
	fftw-3-single @3.2.2_0+i386 (active)
	gsl @1.13_1+darwin_i386 (active)

I also had to build hamlib-1.2.9 (I recall having to do something ugly to
hamlib to get it to compile -- it probably doesn't work).

Get the JACK Audio Connection Kit from from jackosx.com.  I've never
gotten the JACK in fink or macports to work.
